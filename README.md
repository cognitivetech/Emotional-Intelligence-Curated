# Emotional Literacy Curated

* [Emotional Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence)
  > Emotional intelligence (EI), emotional leadership (EL), emotional quotient (EQ) and emotional intelligence quotient (EIQ), is the capability of individuals to recognize their own emotions and those of others, discern between different feelings and label them appropriately, use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior, and manage and/or adjust emotions to adapt to environments or achieve one's goal(s).
* [Emotional Intelligence](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newCDV_59.htm) Developing Strong "People Skills"
  > We probably all know people, either at work or in our personal lives, who are really good listeners. No matter what kind of situation we're in, they always seem to know just what to say – and how to say it – so that we're not offended or upset. They're caring and considerate, and even if we don't find a solution to our problem, we usually leave feeling more hopeful and optimistic.

## Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman

* [Daniel Goleman](http://www.danielgoleman.info/topics/emotional-intelligence/) - Emotional Intelligence
  > And the concept has spread to the far corners of our planet. EQ has become a word recognized, I’m told, in languages as diverse as German and Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, and Malay. (Even so, I prefer EI as the English abbreviation for emotional intelligence.) My e-mail inbox often contains queries, from, for example, a doctoral student in Bulgaria, a school teacher in Poland, a college student in Indonesia, a business consultant in South Africa, a management expert in the Sultanate of Oman, an executive in Shanghai. Business students in India read about EI and leadership; a CEO in Argentina recommends the book I later wrote on the topic. I’ve also heard from religious scholars within Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism that the concept of EI resonates with outlooks in their own faith.
  > 
  > Most gratifying for me has been how ardently the concept has been embraced by educators, in the form of programs in “social and emotional learning or SEL. Back in 1995 I was able to find only a handful of such programs teaching emotional intelligence skills to children. Now, a decade later, tens of thousands of schools worldwide offer children SEL. In the United States many districts and even entire states currently make SEL curriculum requirement, mandating that just as students must attain a certain level of competence in math and language, so too should they master these essential skills for living.

    > **The Ingredients of Emotional Intelligence:**
    > - Self-awareness: the cornerstone of emotional intelligence–a capacity to recognize your feelings as they occur
    > - Emotional control: an ability to manage your emotional reactions, control impulse, and to recover from life’s upsets
    > - Self-motivation: skill at using your emotions in the service of a goal, staying hopeful despite setbacks
    > - Empathy: emotional sensitivity to others; a talent for tuning into others’ feelings, and reading their unspoken messages
    > - Handling relationships: grace in dealing with others–strong social skills are the key to popularity, leadership, and interpersonal effectiveness

## Regulating Emotions

* [Episode 172: Emotional Regulation](https://www.healingpathsrecovery.com/addiction-recovery-podcast/emotional-regulation/)
  > In a continuance of our series on emotional management, we talk about the importance of being able to feel and express our feelings in a healthy way.  Emotions can be intense.  If we haven’t learned how to regulate our emotions, they can spill out in ways that are unhealthy.  Learning this skill can increase our ability to have empathy with others and improve the quality of our relationships. Regulating emotions even has a positive impact on our physical health.

* [Ep #241: Emotional Vocabulary](https://thelifecoachschool.com/podcast/241/)
  > Growing up, nobody ever sits us down and teaches us how to experience emotions. How to describe them. How to understand what we feel in our bodies and associate these feelings with emotions. Distinguishing between different emotions and naming them correctly are crucial aspects of self-study. That’s why developing our emotional vocabulary is so important.
* [Susan David: Emotional Agility](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/sounds-true/insights-at-the-edge/e/56203177) - Sounds True: Insights at the Edge
  > Susan David is a psychologist teaching at Harvard Medical School, cofounder of the Institute of Coaching at McLean Hospital, and the bestselling author of Emotional Agility: Get Unstuck, Embrace Change, and Thrive in Work and Life. In this episode of Insights at the Edge, Tami Simon talks with Susan about modern society's attitudes toward emotion—specifically our tendency to label certain feelings as good or bad, and the dysfunctional behaviors that arise as a result. Susan explains that a much healthier approach is to identify "bad" emotions as "tough" or "difficult," allowing us to examine them in a granular way that helps in processing them. Tami and Susan discuss how this informed method of dealing with emotions can be taught to children, which is especially important for learning not to bottle or brood upon unpleasant feelings.
